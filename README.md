# F103C-MDB
F103C-MDB KiCad Design Files

These files are for the F103C-MDB minimal development board designed by Neko May.

This is intended to be a minimal piece of development hardware for microcontroller applications. It is capable of using an STM32F103CxT6, or any chip with a matching pinout. This includes authentic ST parts with Cortex-M0, M3 and M4F cores as well as Chinese clones thereof, as well as original devices such as the GigaDevice GD32E503CxT6 with a Cortex-M33F core.

Included are all the files necessary to meddle with it in KiCad and to ship it off to a board house like JLCPCB for assembly. If you produce this for any reason please retain the model and attribution, but update the revision information to indicate you've made changes from this version.

(At this time, the files are not yet present. I will upload them once I have chosen a license and verified operation of the prototypes I've ordered.)
